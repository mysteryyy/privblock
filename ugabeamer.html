Hi.  This is a UGA theme for the LaTeX package Beamer.  Actually it's a
hack of a hack, that is, Chris Bourke modified the PaloAlto theme, and I
just modified his.  See the .sty for credits.  What it does is make a
really nice slide presentation using documentclass{beamer} using LaTeX,
much like you
might be used to in Powerpoint. Here's a
screenshot from one of my lectures:

Now, I'm going to assume you're already using beamer to make
presentation slides using LaTeX.  If not, you'll need to set that up.
Here's what I do:

YMMV.  Now what you'll need are three files.  One is called
beamerthemeUGATheme.sty, which either goes in your tex tree, or in the
directory of the document you're creating.  Bit of advice: put it in
your tree, and run texhash.  You'll also need something called
sealuga.pdf.  that makes the little seal in the top left corner.  The
one I use gives a overfull error, but it compiles just fine.  If you
prefer a smaller seal that fits the box better, you can make it from the
following enormous jpg:

<p>
You're also gonna need your .tex file.  I've included the template that
I use, as well as an example template from one of my political philosophy lectures.
I'll also include a bit of a tutorial soon.  I'll put it here:
<p>
<a href="http://rrob.myweb.uga.edu/tutorial.pdf">here</a>

Get all three relevant files here:

<p>
Just send me an email at rrob@uga.edu with any questions, or else
swing by Political Theory in GEO 201C TR at 12:30 to see a demonstration.

I hope this is helpful.<br><hr></body></html>
